# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in the InkScript community a respectful,
inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- Experience level
- Background
- Identity
- Personal beliefs

---

## Expected Behavior

We expect all contributors to:

- Be respectful and considerate
- Assume good intent
- Accept constructive criticism
- Focus on ideas, not individuals
- Use welcoming and inclusive language

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Harassment, discrimination, or insults
- Personal attacks or threats
- Trolling or deliberately disruptive behavior
- Publishing private information without consent
- Aggressive or dismissive responses to questions

This applies to **all spaces**, including:
- GitHub issues
- Pull requests
- Discussions
- Community chats

---

## Design Disagreements

InkScript encourages strong technical debate—but:

- Argue *ideas*, not people
- Back claims with reasoning or examples
- Accept that not all proposals will be accepted
- Maintainers have final say on direction

---

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may take action, including:

- Warning
- Comment removal
- Temporary or permanent bans

Actions are taken to protect the community, not to punish.

---

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Open a private issue (if supported), or
- Contact the maintainers directly at **serverlabdev@proton.me**

All reports will be reviewed fairly and confidentially.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces
and when representing the project publicly.

---

## Acknowledgement

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant,
adapted to fit the InkScript project ethos.

---

## Final Note

InkScript is built for the long term.
Kindness, clarity, and patience are part of the design.
