# Contributing to InkScript

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **InkScript** 🎨  
InkScript exists to make images programmable, deterministic, and future-proof.  
All contributions—code, docs, ideas, or discussion—are welcome.

## 📌 Project Principles

Before contributing, please understand InkScript’s core principles:

- **Text-first**: InkScript is plain text, human-readable, and diff-friendly.
- **Deterministic**: Same input → same output.
- **Tool-agnostic**: No renderer or editor is “official”.
- **Forward-compatible**: New features must not break old files.
- **Simple > Clever**: Clarity beats cleverness.

If a change violates these principles, it will likely be rejected.

## 🧭 Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:

- 🐛 Reporting bugs
- ✨ Proposing new features
- 📚 Improving documentation
- 🧪 Adding tests or examples
- 🎨 Building tools (editors, renderers, converters)

You **do not** need to write code to contribute.

## 🐞 Bug Reports

Please include:

1. InkScript version
2. Minimal `.inks` file that reproduces the issue
3. Expected behavior
4. Actual behavior
5. Renderer/editor used (if any)

Avoid vague reports like “it doesn’t work”.

## ✨ Feature Proposals

Open an issue labeled **`proposal`** and describe:

- The problem being solved
- Why existing grammar is insufficient
- Proposed syntax (with examples)
- Backward compatibility impact

Large features should be discussed **before** implementation.

- Include minimal test cases
- Prefer small, focused commits
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies
- Follow existing formatting and naming conventions

If contributing examples:

- Keep files small
- Comment intent clearly
- Prefer demonstrating one concept per file

- Do **not** reformat unrelated files

PRs may be requested to revise or simplify.

---

## 🏷 Versioning Rules

- **Do not** bump versions without discussion
- Grammar changes must update `SPEC.md`
