## Decision-Making Process

1. Discussion occurs via issues or pull requests
2. Alternatives and trade-offs are considered

Consensus is preferred but **not required**.

---

## Specification Changes

Changes to the InkScript specification must:

- Be documented in `SPEC.md`

Experimental features may be deferred or rejected.

---

## Conflict Resolution

In case of conflict:

## License & Authority

InkScript is licensed under the **Server-Lab Open-Control License (SOCL) 1.0**.

This governance document does not override the license.
In case of conflict, the license terms take precedence.

## Final Note

InkScript is designed as a **foundational format**, not a fast-moving trend.
Governance exists to protect clarity, stability, and long-term usefulness.

Governance is part of the design.
